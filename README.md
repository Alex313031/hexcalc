## About

A small Win32 application for converting between numerical values used in C/C++ programming.

Can convert between int, uint, long, float, double, long double, dword, short hex, long hex, and string representation.

## Building

### Via MinGW
Use the Makefile or `build_mingw.sh`. It should work on Linux, and with MinGW on Windows.  
You can also use my fork of [w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit), called [win32-devkit](https://github.com/Alex313031/win32-devkit).

Using this method, you can compile on Linux, or Windows XP+ (using win32-devkit).

```
make -B all -j# (where # is number of jobs)

```

### With GN/Ninja
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) uses a build system with [GN](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/refs/heads/main/README.md) and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/).

I have made a minimal, modified version configured specifically for compiling Win32 programs
for legacy Windows called [gn-legacy](https://github.com/Alex313031/gn-legacy).  
It can be used on Windows 7+ or Linux. (Unlike the regular MinGW method above, gn.exe does not work on Windows XP/Vista.)

Really, it is a meta-build system. GN stands for "Generate Ninja" and can use __BUILD.gn__ files to
generate `.ninja` files. These are used by Ninja (the actual build system), to run the commands to compile it.  
The compiler itself is dependant on the host platform:  
On Linux, a special MinGW build I compiled on Ubuntu 24.04 to support legacy Windows and use static linkage is used.
On Windows, it simply uses an extracted toolchain from win32-devkit mentioned above.
